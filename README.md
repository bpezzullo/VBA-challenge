# VBA-challenge

VBA work to summarize a list of stocks.  In a separate table place the stock name (ticker), the change for the year, the percent 
change from the opening and the total trading volume.  In addition highlight whether the change was positive or negative by highlighting 
the cell.  Finally identify the stock that made the greatest change, least change, and greatest volume.

Run this across the different spreadsheets in the file.  Each spreadsheet represents a single year and the sheet is order by stock name and then the date of the stock entry in descending order.
